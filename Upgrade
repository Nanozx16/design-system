## **Description**

This PR migrates the current MetaMask design system repo which is
currently using the metamask-module-template and a polyrepo structure to
a monorepo structure. The primary goal is to streamline the module
management process by consolidating multiple repositories into a single
monorepo. The `core` module serves as a reference for the files and
structure required in the monorepo setup. This change will simplify
dependency management and improve development efficiency across modules.

### Key changes:
- Updated module configuration to align with the monorepo structure.
- Consolidated files and dependencies into the monorepo format.
- Ensured consistency with the `core` module in terms of file inclusion,
structure, and build processes.

## **Related issues**

Fixes: #5

## **Manual testing steps**

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the monorepo.
2. Run all `yarn` scripts to ensure they work with the exception of
`prepare-preview-build` and `publish-previews`
3. Verify that the scriptsfunction as expected within the monorepo.
4. Ensure the build passes without issues in the monorepo format.
5. Ensure no instances of "core" remain unless links to information for
migrating packages
